# Goals

- Privacy first: all client-only, works in your own browser, no network or internet use
- Easy mobile-compatible controls
- Not a boring appearance
- The algorithm is flexible enough to handle screenshots that have been cropped ahead of time or not, or a mix of both (so that means title bars, status bars, in common across the tops or bottoms of screenshots will be gracefully skipped if they are not part of the likely-intended scrolling content)
- The algorithm is fast
